# Self-Study Tech Projects

This repository contains a collection of my self-study tech projects, including coursework, exercises, and independent explorations. It serves as a personal archive and showcase of my learning journey in engineering.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Organize all self-study work in one place
- Track personal progress over time
- Demonstrate learning through hands-on projects

> _This repository is a living collection and will be updated regularly as I continue learning and building._
