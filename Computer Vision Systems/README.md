# Computer Vision Systems

This is a self-study project focused on **Computer Vision** and its integration into **vision systems**. It includes learning notes, code experiments, and mini-projects covering both foundational algorithms and practical system applications.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

* Image processing fundamentals
* Classical computer vision (e.g., edge detection, feature extraction)
* Deep learning for vision (CNNs, object detection, segmentation)
* Vision system design (e.g., real-time inference, deployment)
* Tools & libraries: OpenCV, PyTorch, YOLO, etc.

## ðŸš€ Goal

To build a strong foundation in computer vision and understand how to apply it in real-world vision systems.
