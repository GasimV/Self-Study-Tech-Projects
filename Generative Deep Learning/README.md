# Generative Deep Learning (2nd Edition) â€” Study Projects

This repository contains my hands-on study notes and implementation projects based on the book **"Generative Deep Learning (2nd Edition)" by David Foster**. The goal is to learn and explore a wide range of generative AI models using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, by practically applying the concepts introduced in each chapter.

Each major topic or architecture covered in the book is organized into its own directory with:
- Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for implementations
- Summary notes
- Experiment results (where applicable)
- Additional resources or references

## ðŸ“š Covered Topics

Covers the fundamentals of generative modeling, representation learning, and core probability theory, followed by deep learning foundations including neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. Includes practical implementations of generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and autoregressive models like LSTMs and PixelCNN.

Explores advanced generative architectures including normalizing flows (e.g., RealNVP), energy-based models, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Application-focused sections feature Transformer-based architectures for text and music generation (GPT, MuseGAN), advanced GAN variants like StyleGAN2 and ViT-VQGAN, and generative world models for reinforcement learning.

Concludes with cutting-edge multimodal systems such as DALLÂ·E 2, Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and Flamingo, along with discussions on the future directions, use cases, and ethical considerations surrounding generative AI.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Hugging Face

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This self-study project is meant to:
- Reinforce my understanding of generative models through code.
- Build a reusable reference of working implementations.
- Experiment with creative applications of generative AI (images, text, music).
